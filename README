This repository contains MESA inlists for the runs presented in Majidi, Forbes, and Loeb (2022).
These include individual brown dwarf runs that we used to create Figure 1. These were run with mesa-r12778.
We also include the brown dwarf-AGB binary run that produced the data for Figures 4 and 5. This was run with mesa-r15140.
